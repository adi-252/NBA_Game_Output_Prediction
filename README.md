# NBA_Game_Output_Prediction
Developed a machine learning model to predict NBA games

• Executed Sequential Feature Selection out of 288 features, identifying 29 predictive variables that significantly reduced
overfitting while maintaining the model's interpretability.

• Chose a Ridge Classifier, leveraging its strength in handling multicollinearity among features and implemented Timeseries Split
for cross-validation to account for temporal dependencies, ensuring robust assessments for games played over a season.

• Integrated data augmentation and rolling averages analysis to account for momentum and team dynamics.
